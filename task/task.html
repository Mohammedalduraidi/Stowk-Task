                Oh, hey there, TIDWRTWHUFOO fans. Thinking about going for a little dip this summer? How about you go for a swim with a one-ton crab that will smash you under its massive legs? Sound fun? Definitely!
                Crabster is a wild crab-like robot designed to explore the deepest oceans without smashing itself into a squashed tin can. It has massive legs, a large body, and lots of cameras so it can find you even if you’re the dude from The Big Blue and can dive really deep. There’s no escaping our future robotic-aquatic overlords
