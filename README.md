# Stowk Company Task

This task was given by Stowk Company, that i should improve the code (-- html, js, and CSS) within 24 hours and i should refrain from using JQuery or any libraries/frameworks, only pure javascript, html and css.
And there is an extra point that i should add a pause function that pause the text for 2000ms on hover and reverse the sequence until mouse out
